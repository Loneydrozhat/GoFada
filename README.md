A light web crawler/directory brute force scanner written in Golang

## Brief
I have written this mainly as an exercise on Golang, yet it is a fully functional web crawler/directory brute force scanner to be used for mapping standard web applications. It's only 5 MB large and fully text-based, so it might be useful in pivoting scenarios.

This tool is under constant enhancement. Contributions are most welcome. :-)

You might want to take a look at GoFada's board on Trello: https://trello.com/b/j5Hmw6PS/gofada.
## Getting Started
In order to compile GoFada you're supposed to have Go installed. Please refer to https://golang.org/doc/install for detail. Go packages may be installed using go get, e.g.
```
$ go get packagex
```
will install Go's packagex on your system. Make sure all packages imported by GoFada are installed prior to compiling it. Compile by issuing
```
$ go build GoFada.go
```
## Usage
After compiling GoFada, launch it by issuing
```
$ ./GoFada
```
and you'll see a puking stickman, followed by a menu. It is extremely easy to use GoFada since it comes with a text-based menu. For instance, to set a base URL (for crawling/scanning) pick option "1", followed by option "1" as shown below.
```
@> ./GoFada

     (}
    /Y\`;,
    /^\  ;:,
